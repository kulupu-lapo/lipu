### poki Lapo
**poki Lapo** is a library and monolingual corpus for toki pona. Our vision is to expand it to include all types of media in toki pona, including books, poetry, music, comics, posts and more. Files are transcribed by volunteers into Markdown format with metadata and stored in a GitHub repo.  
  
To commit works to poki Lapo, you can clone [the repo](https://github.com/kulupu-lapo/poki) at `kulupu-lapo/poki` on Github. If you do not have experience with git or this feels like a too big commitment, you can also send single entries right from this site using the [/add](./add) feature.  
  
You can also join the **ma pona pi toki pona** discord to talk to the maintainers on our [`#tomo-mute`](https://discord.com/channels/301377942062366741/1252224729977327647)-forum thread.

### lipu Lapo
**lipu Lapo** (this site) is a frontend for [poki Lapo](#poki-lapo). It is hosted on Github pages and based on the Astro static site generator, that renders entries and collections from the markdown files stored in poki Lapo.
